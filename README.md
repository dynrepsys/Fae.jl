# Fae.jl

The Fractal Animation Engine, FAE.jl, is an attempt to use [Iterated Function Systems](https://www.algorithm-archive.org/contents/IFS/IFS.html)(IFS) to create clear, visual scenes.
The principle is simple: an IFS can draw any object with the right set of equations, so if we can find that set of equations, we can render dynamic scenes.

This package uses KernelAbstractions.jl and is built with parallelism and performance in mind.
There are also a bunch of different research projects to look into.

I still need to add docs, tests, and examples before raching V 0.0.1, but we'll get there soon!
